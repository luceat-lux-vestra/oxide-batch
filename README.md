OxideBatch is an enterprise-ready batch processing framework for Rust, inspired
by Spring Batch and designed around idiomatic Rust.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> OxideBatch is in its foundation phase. No production-ready runtime API has
> been released yet.

## Project goals

- Predictable job and step execution semantics
- Durable metadata and restartability
- Chunk-oriented processing with explicit transaction boundaries
- Typed retry, skip, and failure policies
- Operational visibility through structured logs, metrics, and traces
- A conformance suite for documented Spring Batch-compatible behavior

## Repository layout

OxideBatch is a Cargo workspace. `oxide-batch` is the public facade crate.
Additional crates will be introduced only when their boundaries and public
support commitments are clear.

```text
crates/
└── oxide-batch/    Public facade crate
spikes/
└── m0-architecture/ Reproducible, non-published architecture evidence
xtask/              Repository development commands (not published)
```

See [crate publishing policy](docs/governance/crate-publishing.md) for the
planned multi-crate strategy.

## Status

The current milestone is **M0 — Foundation**: governance, compatibility scope,
architecture decisions, and engineering quality gates.

Start with the [documentation index](docs/README.md) and
[M0–M5 delivery roadmap](docs/roadmap.md). Proposed decisions are intentionally
marked and must be approved before implementation depends on them.
